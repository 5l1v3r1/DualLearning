Thanks a lot for your interests to our work. 
I quickly wrap up a multi-gpu version code. (Note that in the submission phase, we use a 1gpu version code. Please let me know if anything we can improve)

Training demo code: example.sh

Inference demo code: batch_test_script_mainbody.sh

The data and the checkpoint are available at:

You need to download them and put them in the working dir. An example is in ``example.sh''
